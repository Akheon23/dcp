Example Additional Replay Commands (the import/user interface)
--------------------------------------------------------------


This directory contains an example set of extensions to the
replay engine.

It builds a shared object called libtemplate.so
(or on HPUX libtemplate.sl).

The object has two example commands:
	HalloWorld      Which prints out a message, and illustrates
			the principle of the user command

	dowhile         An extension that allows you to "loop" commands
			in the Replay engine.


For example, in a replay script you might have:

import template

in ApplicationShell

	user HalloWorld now is the time for all good men

	user dowhile IsSensitive(delete_button) push delete_button




To build this software:
-----------------------

1. check the machine target by typing
	$ make

   (it will print out thelist of known targets - ie machine types)

2. make the shared object for your system, eg for solaris

	$ make solaris

3. install it into the lib/xds directory, where all the Replay objects
   are kept.
