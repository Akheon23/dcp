This is a simple calculator example built using X-Designer.

MCalc               defaults file, the .res files cat together.
Makefile            to make the program
callbacks.c         callback functions
mcalc.bm            logo bitmap
mcalc.c             the main program which #includes one of the generated
		    interfaces.
mcalc.res           main defaults file

Two interfaces are supplied four func and scientific:

fourfunc.xd         X-Designer source
fourfunc.res        generated defaults
fourfunc.xc         generated c

scientific.xd       X-Designer source
scientific.res      generated defaults
scientific.xc       generated c

mcalc.c includes the scientific interface by default. If you want the
fourfunc interface then you must comment out the #include of scientific.xc
in mcalc.c and remove the comments from #include fourfunc.xc.
