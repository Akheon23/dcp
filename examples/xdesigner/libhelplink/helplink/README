This directory contains the files needed to integrate your
application with XD/Help for its online help. 

To use XD/Help, your application must link with:

1. the object file in this directory, which implements the function
   XDhelp_link(), calls to which are generated into your application
   code when it is generated and
2. the client-side XD/Help protocol library, which you will find in
   the directory src/help/client under the root directory of this
   installation

The files in this directory are are:

Makefile     - to make the file helplink.o
helplink.c   - an implementation of the function XDhelp_link, which
               when compiled produces helplink.o
helplink.o   - a file to link with your generated code to supply the
               link between the generated calls and the client-side
		   XD/Help library
