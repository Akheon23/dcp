This directory contains the files needed to integrate your
application with Netscape for its online help.  The files are:

Makefile     - to make the files helplink.o and nscontrol.o
helplink.c   - an implementation of the function XDhelp_link, which
               when compiled produces helplink.o
nscontrol.c  - an implementation of the function SendNetscapeTo, which
		   controls Netscape in a simple manner.
helplink.o   - a file to link with your generated code to interface
               with the Netscape linkup
