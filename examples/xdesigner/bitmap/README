This is a simple bitmap editor that is implemented on Motif and Microsoft Windows.
It's not very functional, but it conveys some of the basic constructs.
In particular there is no feedback during mouse dragging.

The Makefile in motif/ needs the Make macro $XDROOT set to the installation
root directory of X-Designer before you attempt to make anything.
