jsynprog is a java program that loads a C++ shared object, and calls
various routines from it.

jsynprog.main is the main method that calls functions from different
classes.  It uses gethrtime and gethrvtime through JNI calls to time
its own behavior, and writes an accounting file with its own timings,
as well as writing messages to stdout.

It has many methods, each typical of a Java program:

Routine.memalloc does memory allocation, and triggers GC
Routine.add_int does integer addition
Routine.add_double does double (floating point) additions
Sub_Routine.add_int is a derived calls that overrides Routine.add_int
Routine.has_inner_class defines an inner class and uses it
Routine.recurse shows direct recursion
Routine.recursedeep does a deep recursion, to show how the
	tools deal with a truncated stack
Routine.bounce shows indirect recursion, bounce_a calls bounce_b
	which in turn calls bounce_a
Routine.array_op does array operations
Routine.vector_op does vector operations
Routine.sys_op uses methods from the System class
jsynprog.jni_JavaJavaC: Java method calls another Java method that calls a C function
jsynprog.JavaCJava: Java method calls a C function which in turn calls a Java method
jsynprog.JavaCC: Java calls a C function that calls another C function
