synprog example program:

Description:

        The program synprog is a simple program that does a number of
        tasks, each of which exhibits some performance characteristic
        or feature of the Performance Analyzer. This program can be used 
        to explore the Performance Analyzer. 

Makefile:

        make: make the executable synprog.

        make collect: collect the default experiments.

        make clean: remove .o files and core files.

        make clobber: make clean and remove executable and experiment files.

        Notes: 
        (1) A make clobber should be done before building and running
        the program, to clean up any unwanted files. 
        (2) The makefile has a variety of options commented out which control
        the optimization of the program.

Usage:

        synprog

Example Scenario:

        Step 1: Make a copy of the program and makefile.

        Copy the contents of the synprog directory to your own
        private working area with the following command:

                cp -r /opt/SUNWspro/examples/analyzer/synprog <myworkarea>/synprog

        Note: /opt/SUNWspro is the base directory where the product is
        installed. This directory may be different in your environment.

        Step 2: Build the synprog executable

                cd <myworkarea>/synprog
                make

        Step 3: Collect performance data

                make collect

        Step 4: Analyze the performance data

        If you have a license for the GUI, type

                analyzer test.1.er &

	If you do not have the appropriate license, you can use er_print to
	analyze the performance data:

                er_print test.1.er &

        To analyze the experiment on descendant processes, type

                analyzer test.2.er test.2.er/_*.er &

        or

                er_print test.2.er test.2.er/_*.er &

        From this point you can explore the features of the Performance Analyzer
        GUI or CLI and analyze the performance of the synprog program.
