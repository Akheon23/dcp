This directory contains sources for the "Motif" widget integrations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The position-sensitive Motif widgets (eg List, Scale, Scrollbar) are
handled the same way as 3rd party custom widgets. For each widget class,
two routines are registered:

	one to convert from (x,y) to a meaningful description
	another to convert from the meaningful description to (x,y)

We distribute these sources:
	- as full examples of how to integrate a widget
	- so that the record/replay behaviour of a motif widget
	  can be modified if necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The text widget is (by default) treated as a special case.
Our experience is that most test cases benefit from treating
a text widget as something in which new data REPLACES old.
In file selection boxes, for example, you want to put a filename
in the selection field. You are not interested in testing
whether you can insert or otherwise edit the text field.

The default text widget implementation has no notion of position.
You simply push, doubleclick or multiclick the text widget.

If you build this directory -DHANDLE_TEXT=1, you get simple
position sensitive reocrd/replay of text widgets - useful for testing
text widgets that are being used as editors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Input method hooks are also to be found here, for text fields and for
text widgets. The hooks involve registering a Get/Put pair using
xdsIMregister() - in register.c

Note that the current implementation will not allow insertion INTO
a text field via an input method to be replayed. So if you build
-DHANDLE_TEXT=1, you will need a more sophisticated method of interrogating
the input method to identify the inserted text.
