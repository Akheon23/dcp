Example XRT 3rd Party Widget Integration
----------------------------------------


This directory contains an example integration of the XrtTable
widget.

To build this software:
-----------------------

1. Set the environment variable XRTHOME to the XRT distribution root.
2. check the machine target by typing
	$ make

   (it will print out thelist of known targets - ie machine types)

3. make the shared object for your system, eg for solaris

	$ make solaris

4. Copy or link the shared object into the directory $XDROOT/lib/xds

	$ cp libCvtInt.so $XDROOT/lib/xds


The integration will be used whenever needed (ie whenever you try to record
or replay from Xrt (XtXrt...) widgets.




To add other integrations
-------------------------

The file xrt1.c contains the two converter routines required for
the Xrt Table widget.

You will need to write two similar converters for each widget you are
integrating

The file register.c contains the routine that REGISTERS the converters
with the replay software. You will need to add a call for your new
integration.

The makefile is configured to build the object on systems currently
supported. Once built, you should copy or link it into the xds lib
directory.

The other files in the directory SHOULD NOT be touched. The replay software
is a collection of shared objects, with a very simple protocol - using
Xt resources just like widgets do. A 3rd party integration is a very
restricted form of object, where the replay software WILL NOT communicate
with it, other than to create it. During object creation, your registering
code is invoked.
