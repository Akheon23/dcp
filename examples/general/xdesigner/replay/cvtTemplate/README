Example Widget Integration
----------------------------------------


This directory contains an template integration

To build this software:
-----------------------

1. check the machine target by typing
	$ make

   (it will print out thelist of known targets - ie machine types)

2. make the shared object for your system, eg for solaris

	$ make solaris

3. Copy or link the shared object into the directory $XDROOT/lib/xds

	$ cp libTemplate.so $XDROOT/lib/xds



Of course, this is only a template. So don't expect it to do
much until you put your own code in.



To add other integrations
-------------------------

The file template.c contains the two converter routines required for
the (template) widget.

You will need to write two similar converters for each widget you are
integrating

The file register.c contains the routine that REGISTERS the converters
with the replay software. You will need to add a call for your new
integration.

The makefile is configured to build the object on systems currently
supported. Once built, you should copy or link it into the xds lib
directory.

The other files in the directory SHOULD NOT be touched. The replay software
is a collection of shared objects, with a very simple protocol - using
Xt resources just like widgets do. A 3rd party integration is a very
restricted form of object, where the replay software WILL NOT communicate
with it, other than to create it. During object creation, your registering
code is invoked.
